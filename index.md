`2018_2019`
__BLADE (SHADOW)__

Shadow offers an alternative to the obsolescence of computer components by taking them inside the computer and putting them in the cloud. We should then no longer need to change our device every 3/4 years. The use of the computer will turn more into a service where software will always be up to date with the latest components, than a personal asset.

I took care of all the front part of this project in React.JS (including mobx), and a little bit on the server side, especially to set up a Redis cache system. I also took care of CI deployment. We used Cypress to set up our integration tests.

`2017_2018`

Recast.ai is a start-up with a very promising development, and in great demand today, in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Located at Station F, it was acquired by SAP, and it provides customers with a chatbot service, in line with new innovations, notably machine learning, and NLP.

I had the opportunity to develop a chatbot service with pure JS, ES6, with particular emphasis on unit and functional tests.

Also, thanks to my fullstack profile, I'm also in great demand to improve the front, and implement new functionalities in React.JS

CityTaps’ vision is to help bring running water to every urban home, to boost the health, dignity and productivity of the urban poor in developing countries.
