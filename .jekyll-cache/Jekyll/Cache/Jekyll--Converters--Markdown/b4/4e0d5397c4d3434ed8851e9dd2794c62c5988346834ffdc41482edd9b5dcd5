<strong>BLADE (SHADOW)</strong></p>

<p>Shadow offers an alternative to the obsolescence of computer components by taking them inside the computer and putting them in the cloud. We should then no longer need to change our device every 3/4 years. The use of the computer will turn more into a service where software will always be up to date with the latest components, than a personal asset.</p>

<p>I took care of all the front part of this project in React.JS (including mobx), and a little bit on the server side, especially to set up a Redis cache system. I also took care of CI deployment. We used Cypress to set up our integration tests.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to develop a chatbot service with pure JS, ES6, with particular emphasis on unit and functional tests.</p>
